# SIEM-Implementation-Docs
Technical documentation for my SIEM Implementation Capstone project

Overview
This project involved the design and implementation of a cloud-based Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system as part of a 10-week capstone project. The goal was to create a scalable and automated SIEM solution using cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, or GCP) to enhance the security monitoring, incident detection, and response capabilities of organizations.

Over the course of five biweekly sprints, our team of four (Jose Rodriguez, Jesus Ayala, D'Andre Walden, and Jasmine Melton) worked collaboratively to develop the architecture, implement security automation, and create an intuitive user interface for ongoing security monitoring. We focused on creating an efficient system for collecting, aggregating, and analyzing security data, while also addressing key challenges such as reducing alert fatigue, improving response times, and ensuring long-term scalability.

Key Deliverables
Cloud Infrastructure: We designed a secure cloud infrastructure leveraging AWS services, including IAM roles, CloudWatch, S3, and Kinesis, to support SIEM functionality.
Security Automation: Implemented automated threat detection, alerting, and correlation mechanisms to improve incident response times and reduce unnecessary alerts.
User Interface: Developed an intuitive UI for security professionals to monitor and interact with the system.
Results: The final solution significantly enhanced security visibility, reduced incident response times, and improved overall security posture.
Technologies Used:
Cloud Platforms: AWS (VPC, IAM, CloudWatch, S3, Kinesis)
Security Tools: AWS Security Hub, Splunk Cloud, and other monitoring tools
Automation: Log collection, aggregation, and automated alert correlation
Project Management: Trello for task management and team collaboration


# Why This Project Matters
With the increasing complexity and volume of cyber threats, organizations need robust, scalable solutions for detecting and responding to security incidents. This cloud-based SIEM system provides a comprehensive and automated approach to managing and responding to security events in real time, enhancing the security operations of any organization.
